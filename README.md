##  Project Title

**Dog Adoption Single Page Application**

---

##  Project Description

This project is a **Dog Adoption Single Page Application (SPA)** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It demonstrates how to fetch and display data dynamically from a **real external public API** — the **[Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)** — with no page reloads.

The app allows users to:
- View random adoptable dogs with their images and breed names.
- “Adopt” (favorite) dogs, which moves them into a separate **Favorites** section.
- Remove dogs from their Favorites.
- Filter/search dogs by breed or name in real-time.

All interactions are handled entirely on the **frontend** using JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling.

 **Adopt Dogs:** Users can click to “adopt” dogs and add them to their Favorites list.  
**Remove Dogs:** Favorites can be removed individually.  
**Search:** A dynamic filter lets users find dogs by breed or name.  
**SPA:** The app runs fully on a single page with **no redirects** or reloads.  
**Clean UI:** Basic, clear styling with CSS.
